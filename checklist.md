## ‚ùå Known Issues/Deviations
1. FormField component has TypeScript errors with prop passing that need to be resolved
2. Some test files might need additional coverage for edge cases
3. Need to verify Jest configuration works with Next.js 13 app router
4. Header and MainLayout components still need route type updates

## üìù Todo List

### High Priority
1. Fix FormField TypeScript errors
2. Complete route type safety implementation for remaining components
3. Add tests for route type utilities and components
4. Complete MainLayout component implementation
5. Add more comprehensive test coverage
6. Set up proper error handling system
7. Implement loading states and spinners

## üìå Notes
- Need to decide on state management solution (Context vs Redux vs Zustand)
- Consider implementing a component library like shadcn/ui
- May need to add internationalization support
- Consider adding analytics tracking
- Plan for scaling and performance optimization

## üîÑ Next Steps
1. Complete MainLayout component
2. Begin implementing authentication system
3. Set up proper error handling
4. Add loading states and feedback mechanisms
