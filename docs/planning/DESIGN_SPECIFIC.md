# AI Tribes Next.js Project Design Document

## Project Overview
AI Tribes is a platform for creating and managing AI-powered communities with specific focus on:
- Tribe-based organization of AI communities
- Multi-chain wallet integration
- Social media features
- Token-gated access
- KYC verification

## Architecture Evolution

### Current State
Our codebase currently has:
- Scattered components in a flat structure
- Mixed routing paradigms (Pages + App Router)
- Inconsistent feature implementations
- Poor separation of concerns

### Target State
We're evolving towards:
- Feature-based architecture
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe implementations
- Proper testing coverage

## Feature Modules

### 1. Authentication & KYC
Current:
- Scattered across `src/components/auth/` and `src/components/kyc/`
- Mixed authentication methods
- Incomplete KYC flow

Target (`src/features/auth/`):
```
auth/
├── components/          # Auth UI components
│   ├── Login/
│   ├── KYC/
│   └── Profile/
├── api/                # Auth API routes
├── hooks/              # Auth-related hooks
├── types/              # Auth types
└── utils/              # Auth utilities
```

### 2. Wallet Integration
Current:
- Isolated in `src/components/wallet/`
- Basic wallet connection
- Limited chain support

Target (`src/features/wallet/`):
```
wallet/
├── components/         # Wallet UI components
├── api/               # Blockchain interactions
├── hooks/             # Wallet hooks
├── types/             # Wallet & chain types
└── utils/             # Blockchain utilities
```

### 3. Tribe Management
Current:
- Basic implementation in `src/components/tribes/`
- Limited functionality
- No proper data management

Target (`src/features/tribes/`):
```
tribes/
├── components/         # Tribe UI components
├── api/               # Tribe management API
├── hooks/             # Tribe-related hooks
├── types/             # Tribe types
└── utils/             # Tribe utilities
```

### 4. Payment Systems
Current:
- Split between `payment/` and `pricing/`
- Incomplete integrations
- No proper error handling

Target (`src/features/payments/`):
```
payments/
├── components/         # Payment UI components
│   ├── stripe/
│   └── crypto/
├── api/               # Payment processing
├── hooks/             # Payment hooks
├── types/             # Payment types
└── utils/             # Payment utilities
```

## Core Infrastructure

### 1. Shared Components
```
src/components/
├── ui/                # Basic UI components
│   ├── Button/
│   ├── Modal/
│   └── Form/
├── layout/            # Layout components
└── shared/            # Shared feature components
```

### 2. Core Utilities
```
src/lib/
├── api/              # API utilities
├── auth/             # Auth utilities
├── blockchain/       # Blockchain utilities
└── storage/          # Storage utilities
```

### 3. App Router Structure
```
src/app/
├── (auth)/           # Auth routes
├── (dashboard)/      # Dashboard routes
├── (public)/         # Public routes
└── api/              # API routes
```
