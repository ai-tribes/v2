Code Organization Issues:

1. Mixed Routing Paradigms:
   - Both /pages and /app directories present
   - This suggests incomplete migration to Next.js 13+ App Router
   - Need to standardize on App Router and remove Pages Router

2. Directory Structure Concerns:
   - Multiple asset locations (/public/assets, /src/assets)
   - Multiple style locations (/src/styles, /app/*.module.css)
   - Potential duplicate functionality between /utils and /hooks
   - Config split between /src/config and root config files

3. Component Organization:
   - Need to verify component categorization
   - Check for component reusability
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns
   - Verify proper use of hooks and contexts

4. Type System:
   - /types directory exists but need to verify coverage
   - Check for proper type exports
   - Verify type usage across components
   - Ensure proper type safety

5. State Management:
   - Multiple contexts in /contexts
   - Need to verify state management patterns
   - Check for prop drilling issues
   - Verify context boundaries

6. Code Duplication:
   - Multiple similar components possible
   - Utils might have duplicate functionality
   - Hooks might have overlapping functionality
   - Styles might have redundant definitions

7. File Organization:
   - Need consistent file naming convention
   - Need consistent directory structure
   - Need proper index exports
   - Need proper module boundaries

8. Code Splitting:
   - Verify proper use of dynamic imports
   - Check bundle sizes
   - Verify route-based code splitting
   - Check for unnecessary imports

Action Items:

1. Routing Migration:
   - Complete migration to App Router
   - Remove Pages Router code
   - Update all routing logic
   - Update all navigation components

2. Asset Organization:
   - Consolidate assets in one location
   - Organize by type and purpose
   - Implement proper asset optimization
   - Set up proper asset loading

3. Component Structure:
   - Implement proper component hierarchy
   - Create shared component library
   - Document component usage
   - Implement proper prop types

4. Type System:
   - Complete type coverage
   - Create proper type exports
   - Implement stricter type checking
   - Document type usage

5. State Management:
   - Review and consolidate contexts
   - Implement proper state patterns
   - Document state flow
   - Optimize state updates

6. Code Quality:
   - Remove duplicate code
   - Create shared utilities
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add proper logging

7. Build Optimization:
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Optimize bundle sizes
   - Implement proper caching
   - Add performance monitoring

Next Steps:
1. Audit each directory for actual usage
2. Create component inventory
3. Document state flow
4. Create migration plan
5. Implement changes systematically

This is an initial analysis based on directory structure. We'll need to examine actual code files to verify these issues and potentially identify more.
