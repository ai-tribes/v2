Initial Project Structure Issues:

1. Configuration File Redundancy:
   - Multiple Next.js config files present: next.config.js, next.config.mjs, next.config.ts
   - This can cause confusion and potential conflicts
   - Need to standardize on one (preferably next.config.mjs for modern ESM)

2. Legacy/Deprecated Files:
   - 'notpages' directory suggests old Next.js pages structure
   - Contains 'notroadmap.js' and 'nottoken.js' which seem to be deprecated
   - Need to clean up or migrate these to the app router structure

3. Mixed Component Technologies:
   - Mix of .jsx and .tsx files (e.g., in roadmap components)
   - Should standardize on TypeScript (.tsx) for consistency

4. Asset Organization Issues:
   - Multiple version files (ai-tribes-0.0.3.txt, ai-tribes-NEXT.txt)
   - Redundant CSS locations (public/assets/css and src/app/styles)
   - JS files in multiple locations (public/assets/js and src/js)

5. Documentation Structure:
   - Business documents mixed with code (financials.xlsx, roadmap.tex)
   - Should be moved to a dedicated docs directory outside source

6. Component Organization:
   - Some components have their own modules while others share directories
   - Inconsistent module naming (some use index.tsx, others direct names)
   - Need to standardize component organization pattern

7. Static Assets:
   - Many asset directories seem to lack proper organization
   - Multiple directories for similar purposes (images, heroimages, icons)
   - Need to consolidate and organize static assets

8. Build Configuration:
   - Multiple configuration files present (eslint.config.mjs, tsconfig.json)
   - Need to verify all are necessary and properly configured

9. HTML Files in React Project:
   - Standalone HTML files (team.html, token.html) in root
   - These should be converted to React components if still needed

10. Potential Dead Code:
    - 'old' directory in components suggests deprecated code
    - Need to verify if these are still needed or can be removed

Action Items:
1. Consolidate configuration files
2. Clean up deprecated directories and files
3. Standardize on TypeScript
4. Reorganize asset structure
5. Separate documentation from source code
6. Implement consistent component organization
7. Clean up static assets
8. Verify build configurations
9. Convert standalone HTML to React
10. Remove dead code

This is just the initial structural analysis. We'll need to dive deeper into each component and configuration file to identify more specific issues.
