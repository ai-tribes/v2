Asset Management Issues:

1. Asset Organization:
   - Scattered SVG files in public root
   - Multiple overlapping directories (images, heroimages, icons)
   - No clear naming convention
   - Redundant assets likely present

2. Asset Optimization:
   - Large video file (3.5MB herovideo1.mp4) without optimization
   - PNG files not optimized (tribes_logo.png is 255KB)
   - No WebP alternatives for images
   - No responsive image sizes

3. Asset Location Issues:
   - JS files in public/assets/js (should be in src)
   - CSS files in public/assets/css (should be in src)
   - Documentation in public/assets/docs (should be outside)
   - Mixing of asset types

4. Directory Structure:
   - Too many top-level directories
   - Similar content split across directories:
     * social/ and socialloginpng/
     * images/, heroimages/, and icons/
     * logos/ and tribes_logo.png
   - No clear organization strategy

5. Missing Optimizations:
   - No image lazy loading configuration
   - No video streaming setup
   - No asset preloading strategy
   - No clear caching policy

6. Asset Version Control:
   - Large binary files in git
   - No clear asset versioning strategy
   - Missing asset optimization in build process
   - No CDN configuration

Action Items:

1. Asset Reorganization:
   - Consolidate similar directories
   - Implement clear naming convention
   - Move non-public files to src
   - Create proper asset hierarchy

2. Asset Optimization:
   - Implement image optimization
   - Add video compression
   - Generate WebP versions
   - Create responsive sizes

3. Build Process:
   - Add asset optimization step
   - Configure proper caching
   - Implement preloading
   - Set up CDN delivery

4. Directory Structure:
   - /public
     ├── static/
     │   ├── images/
     │   │   ├── icons/
     │   │   ├── logos/
     │   │   └── photos/
     │   ├── videos/
     │   └── fonts/
     └── assets/
         ├── tribes/
         ├── marketing/
         └── docs/

5. Asset Management:
   - Implement proper lazy loading
   - Add asset versioning
   - Configure caching
   - Set up monitoring

Critical Issues:
1. Unoptimized assets
2. Poor directory organization
3. Misplaced source files
4. Missing build optimizations
5. No CDN strategy

This analysis shows significant issues with asset management that need to be addressed for better performance and maintainability.
