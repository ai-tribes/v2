Component and Routing Issues:

1. Component Organization Problems:
   - Flat component structure with 20+ top-level directories
   - Mix of feature-based and type-based organization
   - Inconsistent component naming (some PascalCase, some kebab-case)
   - No clear shared/common components strategy

2. App Router Implementation Issues:
   - Incomplete migration (still has pages directory)
   - Missing route groups for better organization
   - No error boundaries or loading states in many routes
   - Inconsistent use of server/client components

3. Component Architecture Issues:
   - Basic Button component at root level
   - ClientBootstrap suggests client/server component confusion
   - No clear pattern for component composition
   - Missing component documentation

4. Feature Organization:
   - Multiple related features split across directories:
     * Payment, Pricing, and Wallet could be consolidated
     * Auth and KYC could be combined
     * Team and Social Media might overlap
   - No clear boundaries between features

5. Styling Issues:
   - Multiple CSS approaches:
     * Global CSS in app/globals.css
     * CSS Modules scattered across components
     * Inline styles likely present
   - No consistent styling strategy
   - Large CSS files (landing.module.css is 6.9KB)

6. Layout and Navigation:
   - Multiple navigation components (Navbar, Header)
   - Layout implementation might not use new App Router layouts
   - Potential duplicate layout code
   - No clear responsive design strategy

7. API Integration:
   - API routes mixed with pages
   - No clear API versioning strategy
   - Missing API documentation
   - No clear error handling pattern

8. Performance Concerns:
   - Large component directories suggest possible code splitting issues
   - No clear lazy loading strategy
   - Multiple CSS files could affect performance
   - Static and dynamic rendering not clearly separated

Action Items:

1. Component Reorganization:
   - Implement feature-based organization
   - Create shared component library
   - Standardize naming conventions
   - Add component documentation

2. App Router Migration:
   - Complete migration from pages to app router
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Add error boundaries
   - Use route groups for organization

3. Feature Consolidation:
   - Combine related features
   - Establish clear feature boundaries
   - Implement proper data flow
   - Document feature interactions

4. Styling Strategy:
   - Choose primary styling approach
   - Implement design system
   - Consolidate CSS files
   - Add responsive design patterns

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add lazy loading
   - Optimize CSS delivery
   - Separate static/dynamic content

6. API Architecture:
   - Organize API routes
   - Implement versioning
   - Add proper error handling
   - Create API documentation

Priority Issues:
1. Complete App Router migration
2. Consolidate related features
3. Implement consistent styling strategy
4. Add proper error handling
5. Document component usage

This analysis reveals significant architectural issues that need to be addressed for better maintainability and performance.
