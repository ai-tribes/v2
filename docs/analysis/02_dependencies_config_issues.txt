Dependency and Configuration Issues:

1. Next.js Configuration Issues:
   - Three competing Next.js config files (next.config.js, next.config.mjs, next.config.ts)
   - Using Next.js 14.2.22 which isn't a valid version (latest is 14.0.4)
   - Need to standardize on one config file and correct version

2. Package Version Issues:
   - Bootstrap v5.3.3 specified but not yet released (latest is 5.3.2)
   - Very loose version specifications (^) could cause inconsistency issues
   - Some dependencies might need to be moved to devDependencies

3. Missing Critical Dependencies:
   - No ESLint dependencies despite having eslint.config.mjs
   - No styling dependencies (CSS modules are used but no preprocessor specified)
   - No testing framework dependencies
   - No state management library
   - Missing @stripe/stripe-js for frontend Stripe integration

4. TypeScript Configuration:
   - Basic tsconfig.json present but might need stricter settings
   - Using TypeScript but some files are still .js/.jsx
   - No strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json

5. Development Tools:
   - No formatting tools (Prettier) configured
   - No Git hooks (husky, lint-staged) for code quality
   - No build optimization tools configured

6. Security Concerns:
   - Stripe integration but no environment variable handling visible
   - No security-focused dependencies (helmet, cors, etc.)

7. Build Script Issues:
   - Basic Next.js scripts only
   - No testing scripts
   - No type checking script
   - No security audit script
   - No production optimization scripts

Action Items:
1. Standardize Next.js configuration:
   - Remove redundant config files
   - Update to correct Next.js version
   - Configure proper build settings

2. Fix dependency issues:
   - Update to correct versions
   - Add missing critical dependencies
   - Move development dependencies to devDependencies
   - Lock versions more strictly

3. Enhance development setup:
   - Add ESLint with proper configuration
   - Add Prettier
   - Configure Git hooks
   - Add testing framework
   - Add security tools

4. Improve TypeScript configuration:
   - Enable strict mode
   - Add stricter compiler options
   - Configure proper path aliases

5. Enhance build process:
   - Add comprehensive testing script
   - Add type checking script
   - Add security audit script
   - Add production optimization

6. Security improvements:
   - Add security-focused dependencies
   - Configure proper environment variable handling
   - Add security headers

Required New Dependencies:
- eslint and related plugins
- prettier
- husky + lint-staged
- jest + testing-library
- @stripe/stripe-js
- helmet
- proper environment variable handling

This analysis focuses on the build and configuration aspects. We'll need to verify these against the actual codebase usage patterns.
